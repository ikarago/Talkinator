# Talkinator
Talkinator is an easy to use text-to-speech-app for Windows 10-devices that was originally made in a lost afternoon. Now, it became bigger and better, with the ability to export your spoken text to soundfiles and by becoming completely open-source.


You can download the app itself from here: https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9nblggh4spnl
