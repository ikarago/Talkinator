# Talkinator
Talkinator is an easy to use text-to-speech-app for Windows 10-devices that was originally made in a lost afternoon. Now, it became bigger and better, with the ability to export your spoken text to soundfiles and by becoming completely open-source.

## Get the app
You can download the app itself from here: https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9nblggh4spnl

Or you can build and learn from it yourself by downloading or forking this project

## Supported Windows versions
**For modern Talkinator rewrite:** Minimal 16299 (Fall Creators Update)

**For classic Talkinator:** Anything from 14393 (Anniversary Update) and up if you remove the Acrylic backgrounds


**Currently supported systems:**

* Windows 10 Desktop ✔
* Windows 10 Mobile ✔
* Windows 10 Team ✔
* Windows 10 Holographic ❌
* Windows 10 Xbox ✔


## Building the app
You can download the project so you can tinker around with it yourself. There are two projects in the solution:

* **Talkinator.UWP.Classic** --> The original (messy) source code
* **Talkinator.UWP** --> A (work in progress) rewrite of the code in MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel). There are still features missing from this version at this moment.
